Couple budgeting app

## Problem
Most budgeting apps are great for a single user but don't have a strong feature set to support a joint user experience.

## Solution
Create an app that is built around the idea of supporting a "couples" budget.

## Design
A "couple" would be able to create an account that allows them to edit/view a budget together.  The account would allow for bill reminders, savings goals, and income/expense tracking.

* **Bill Reminders:** Send a notification to both users when the due date of a bill approaches and send a notification when a bill is paid.

* **Savings Goals:** Create an exciting UI that encourages couples to save towards important financial goals and send encouraging notifications when certain thresholds are reached.

* **Income/Expense Tracking:** There are a lot of ways this could be approached.  What came to my mind was to have a "zero base budget".  The idea is that couples would zero out their income and expenses making sure every dollar is accounted for.  This would help couples plan their monthly budget and make sure both partners understand their financial goals together.

The overall design would be very simple and easy to navigate allowing couples a stress-free budget plan.
